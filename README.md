For security reasons, I need some information on my phone that I don't want to show.

From here I generated an HTML page with the encrypted content.

On my computer I made an HTML page in which I put the encrypted content and then saved it in the file that I carry
with me.

I used the crypto.js library.

Now I feel much more relaxed.
